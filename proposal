    <p class="fade-in">
      Just five days after our first interaction, I couldn't wait any longer and decided to propose to her on December 19, 2020. It was a nerve-wracking moment, but I gathered all my courage and expressed my feelings for her.

    <p class="fade-in">
      On December 24, 2020, she gave me the best gift I could ever ask for â€” her acceptance. She agreed to be my wife, and my heart was filled with joy and gratitude. It marked the beginning of a new chapter in our lives together.
